**A series of tests made together with students for the purpose of Tangible Interaction Design classes at Industrial Design faculty. I decided to put it online as a reference for future projects.**

## Sensors tested:
### Ultrasonic sensors:
- **HC-SR04**: We had two kinds of these. We've tested various tricks to improve their measurements.
- **Sparkfun HC-SR04**: to compare the quality with cheaper ones. *Is it worth it?*
- **DFRobot Gravity URM07**
- **DFRobot Gravity URM09**
- **DFRobot Gravity URM37 v5**

### Infrared sensors:
- 

### Time of Flight sensors:
*Can't be used with 16 Mhz Arduino boards.*
- **Pololu VL53L3CX**

## Testing conditions:
### Locations:
- Open space.
- Hallway wide and narrow.
- On a table.

*We've tried to test with and without background elements.*

### Measurments:
*We've measured different kind of objects with:*
- Flat surface.*
- Uneven surface.*
- Narrow object.
- Material.
- Hand movement.
- Pedestrian.

**Small and larger object.*

## Results:
